# BreadboardComputerEEPROM

Code I wrote to program CAT28C16AP EEPROMs with an arduino nano based off of Ben Eater's Youtube series on the 8-bit breadboard computer.

UPDATE: I gave up on the arduino programmer because I was having so many problems with it. Instead I used the XGecu Pro universal EEPROM Programmer and a BIN file.
